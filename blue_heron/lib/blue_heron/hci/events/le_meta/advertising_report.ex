  A struct representing a LE Advertising Report.

  > The LE Advertising Report event indicates that one or more Bluetooth devices have responded to
  > an active scan or have broadcast advertisements that were received during a passive scan. The
  > Controller may queue these advertising reports and send information from multiple devices in
  > one LE Advertising Report event.
  >
  > This event shall only be generated if scanning was enabled using the LE Set Scan Enable
  > command. It only reports advertising events that used legacy advertising PDUs.
