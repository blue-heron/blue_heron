  HCI commands for working with the Link Policy.

  > The Link Policy Commands provide methods for the Host to affect

  > used, the LM still controls how Bluetooth piconets and scatternets are
  > established and maintained, depending on adjustable policy parameters.
  > These policy commands modify the Link Manager behavior that can result
  > in changes to the link layer connections with Bluetooth remote devices
